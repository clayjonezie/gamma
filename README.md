An interpreted notepad style calculator for various calculations in non-formal text. Also variables. In the browser. Inspired by http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/

Goal: something like this example for a quick budget. 

```
This month:
rent = -600 a month
food = -15 a day * 30 days
income = 7.50 an hour * 40 hours * 4 weeks

```
Output:
```
This month
-600
-450
1200
TOTAL: 150
```
